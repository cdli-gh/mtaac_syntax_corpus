Ur III royal inscriptions, annotation projection
=

Perform annotation projection over CDLI versions of ETSCRI data, using CDLI translations (where available) or ETSCRI translations (only where no CDLI translation).
Note that this annotation projection is *not* identical to the one we arrive at with the parallel section of the full Ur III graph because text extraction and 
translations considered are different, and because alignment is performed on royal inscriptions only.

Also, the projection process may be adjusted independently from the full parallel corpus to address domain specifics.
