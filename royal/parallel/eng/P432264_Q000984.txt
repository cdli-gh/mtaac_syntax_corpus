: For Nanna,
: his beloved master -
: the Dublamah,
: since ancient days
: though not an offering(?) place
: where daily rations had been withdrawn
: having become,
: since its temple had not been rebuilt
: Amar-Suena,
: beloved by Nanna,
: whom, in Nippur,
: Enlil
: chose by name,
: the constant supporter
: of the temple of Enlil,
: the mighty man,
: king of Ur
: and king of the four world quarters,
: the Dublamah,
: the temple which is the wonder of the country,
: his place of judgment,
: where from his net
: the enemies
: of Amar-Suena
: do not escape,
: that temple he rebuilt
: and made resplendent for him.
: With gold, silver and lapis lazuli
: he decorated it for him.
: Amar-Suen
: shall therewith prolong his life.
: A person who, when the temple has become old,
: having rebuilt it,
: but this inscription
: and its utensils
: from its standing-place
: does not change,
: in the eyes of Nanna
: may he find favor.
: But a person who this inscription
: shall erase
: and its utensils
: to its standing-place
: shall not return,
: may the serpent of Nanna
: be set upon him,
: and to his descendants
: may Nanna
: make an end.
