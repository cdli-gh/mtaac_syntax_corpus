To Nanna, the impetuous calf of An,
the lord, the first-born son of Enlil,
his master,
Ibbi-Sîn,
the god of his country,
the mighty king,
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters,
his speckled Meluḫḫa 'dog',
from Marḫaši
brought by them as tribute,
a replica of it
he fashioned,
and for his life
he dedicated it to him.
Of that speckled dog:
Grab Him!
is its name.
