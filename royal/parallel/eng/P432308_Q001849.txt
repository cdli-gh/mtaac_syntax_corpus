: that spreads over his people,
: the lord who alone is a resplendent god,
: his master,
: Ibbi-Sîn,
: the god of his country,
: the mighty king,
: king of Ur
: and king of the four world quarters,
: when in Susa,
: Adamšaḫ,
: (and) the land of Awan
: he roared like a storm,
: made them submit in a single day,
: and took their lord(s) into captivity -
: a golden alabastrum vessel,
: a work artifully wrought
: which he with bison bulls and snakes
: and terrifying dark rain (clouds)
: had decorated
: to be an endless marvel,
: and which at the great festival of the new year, the bath
: of Nanna,
: at the treasure-chest location, where during its head-anointing ritual
: it should never stop (being used),
: he fashioned for him,
: and for his life
: he dedicated it to him.
