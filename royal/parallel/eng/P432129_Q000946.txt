For Nanna, 
the first-born son 
of Enlil, 
his master, 
Ur-Namma, 
the mighty man, 
king of Ur 
and king of Sumer and Akkad, 
a swamp planted with (palm) seedlings - 
it was indeed a swamp - 
a field of it 
which was 3600 (bur3) in area (= 233.28 sq. km)   
from the water 
he brought out for him.  
Levees for it, 4 danna (= 43.2 km) and 260 nindan (= 1560 m),  
he made for him. 
Next to Ur, as a (lasting) treasure 
he made it. 
Of that canal: Who Is Like Nanna 
is its name.
