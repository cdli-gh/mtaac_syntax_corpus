For Nanna, 
the first-born son of Enlil, 
his master, 
Ur-Namma, 
the mighty man, 
king of Ur 
and king of Sumer and Akkad, 
when the temple of Enlil 
he had built, 
the canal 
whose name is Nanna the Canal Inspector, 
which is the boundary canal, 
he dug. 
Its mouth he extended into the sea. 
By a rightful decision 
of Utu, 
he chose it 
and confirmed it. 
A person who 
to Nanna 
has become hostile, 
whether he be a king 
or whether he be a governor, 
as a person cursed 
by Nanna 
may he become. 
Within the residence of Nanna 
may he be defiled. 
May his city out among the reed huts(?) 
roam around. 
May life a bitter thing to him 
indeed be.
