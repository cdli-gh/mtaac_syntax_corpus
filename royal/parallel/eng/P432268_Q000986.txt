For Inanna,
the queen of battle,
his beloved spouse,
Amar-Suena,
whom Enlil
in Nippur
chose by name,
the constant supporter
of the temple of Enlil,
the mighty king,
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters,
her bronze argibil-structure
of the Gipar temple
he fashioned for her,
and for his life
he dedicated it to her.
