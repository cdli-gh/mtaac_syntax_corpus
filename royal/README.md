Ur III royal inscriptions

This is an excerpt of the dependency parse of the ETCSRI corpus (Ur III section), see https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac-syntax-etscri for source data and acknowledgements.
At the moment, we provide 

(a) automated pre-annotation (using an ETSCRI-specific pre-annotator), transformed to CDLI morphology and 
(b) annotation projection from English

TODO:
- merge pre-annotation with annotation projection from translated subcorpus (cf. directory `eng/`)
- adjust annotations to revised MTAAC conventions (e.g., replace DAT-H/DAT-NH with DAT, L1 with LOC, etc.)
- add acknowledgments to ETCSRI developers
