This is an excerpt of the dependency parse of the ETCSRI corpus (Ur III section), see https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac-syntax-etscri for source data and acknowledgements.
At the moment, we provide 

- `cdli/` CDLI-ATF and derived CoNLL files
- `etcsri/` ETCSRI corpus automated pre-annotation for syntactic dependencies (using an ETSCRI-specific pre-annotator) and its transformation to CDLI morphology
- `parallel/` annotation projection from English using CDLI or ETCSRI translations
- `merged/` semiautomatically merged files with original CDLI CoNLL, transformed ETCSRI annotation (forced alignment), transformed ETCSRI annotation (Levenshtein alignment), and projected annotations

TODO:
- add acknowledgments to ETCSRI developers
