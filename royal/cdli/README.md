# Ur-III royal subcorpus, CDLI/MTAAC source files

`atf` from daily dump, Oct 8, 2020 (https://cdli.ucla.edu/bulk_data/), names changed to P_Q schema

`conll` from MTAAC Ur III corpus, https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_cdli_ur3_corpus, names changed to P_Q schema

Note that incomplete translations have been corrected in the atf files. These have not been fed back into CDLI, for two reasons: 

(1) Some lines in the ATF files are correct but have been removed here because they interfered with the extraction of translations. Feeding this information back into CDLI would mean to remove valid information.

(2) All additions have been done by analogy with other translations in the Ur-III corpus, but without the consultation of an expert. This means, for example, that the correct translation variant of a word may actually differ from the one assumed here. As an example, szagina is translated variously as "general", "military governor", or "governor-general" (these interpretations differ with respect to whether the respective rank is relative to a military unit or relative to a specific region), and the respective translations require a deeper understanding of the context, e.g., the role of the individual described by the term in *other* texts. However, for the sake of annotation projection, these interpretation variants will not have an impact on the syntactic relations.
